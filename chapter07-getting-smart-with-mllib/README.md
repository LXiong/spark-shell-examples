Spark in Action: Shell programs
===============================

# Chapter 7: Getting smart with MLlib

## 01-local-vectors
Illustrates how to create sparse and dense vectors and how access individual elements within the vector and query the vector size.

## 02-breeze-vectors
Illustrates how to transform Spark vectors into Breeze vectors using Scala so that you can leverage the Breeze linear algebra functions.

## 03-local-dense-matrices
Illustrates how to create a local dense matrix.

## 04-identity-and-diagonal-matrices
Illustrate how to create dense identity, ones, zeros and diagonal matrices.

## 05-local-sparse-matrices
Illustrates how to create matrices using the CSC (Compressed Sparse Column) format, and how to transform a sparse matrix to a dense matrix and how to transform a dense matrix into a sparse matrix.

## 06-linear-algebra-on-local-matrices
Illustrate how to access individual elements of a matrix and how to perform the `transpose` operation.

## 07-rowmatrix-toindexedrowmatrix
Illustrate how to convert a rowmatrix to an indexed row matrix. This example is not a standalone example and cannot be run.

## 08-housing-analysis-and-preparation
Illustrates how to perform the preparation and performance evaluation of a linear regression model until the point in which you want to save it in your system.

## 09-loading-saved-model
Illustrates how to load a previously saved model.

## 10-iterate-find-right-step-size-and-iterations
Illustrates how you can define a supporting function that lets you find the adequate values for the step size and number iterations.

## 11-non-linear-regression
Illustrates how to create a model using higher-order polynomials instead of a linear regression model.
